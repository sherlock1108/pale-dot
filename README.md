# My Text & Notes Archive

A curated collection of notes, slides, and short writeups I keep while reading and building projects.  
This repo groups materials by topic (see the `astrophysics/` folder and its children). Files are mostly Markdown and simple text so everything is human-readable.

Please find my CV & portfolio (it has a summary of my profile) in the main directory.

How this repo is organised
- Topic folders (e.g., `astrophysics/`) contain a `README.md` explaining the folder and short indices.
- Individual items (e.g., `ss-cygni/`, `blackbody-ppt/`) contain the original file(s) and a short README describing purpose and provenance.
  

- I keep versions explicit in commit messages; check file history on GitHub for older drafts.
